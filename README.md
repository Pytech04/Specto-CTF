# 🛰️ Intercepted Signal Found!

An unknown hacker has been secretly transmitting encoded messages using radio frequencies.  
Our intelligence team has intercepted one such transmission in the form of a `.wav` file — but the message is **encrypted**!

Your mission is to:

1. Analyze the signal 🔍  
2. Extract the raw binary data 🧬  
3. Transform and decrypt it 🔓  
4. Recover the hidden flag 🏁
